# Project Title: WordGuessGame

## This is part of an assignment for the UofT Full Stack Bootcamp Program

## The goal is to create a basic Hangman Game

### Built using basic Javascript, Minimal CSS and HTML

### I kept the code fairly simple and did not apply a lot of CSS. My goal was to focus on the Javascript element of this assignment. Its better to have working ugly code that beautiful non-functional code.
